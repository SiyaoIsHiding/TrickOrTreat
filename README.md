# TrickOrTreat

It is a game deployed on [Itch.IO](https://ginvr.itch.io/take-one), developed in two days during [Proto Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/vgdc-proto-game-jam-2022/rate/1759332), which is held by University of California, Irvine Video Game Development Club.

It's the night of Halloween, and kids are roaming about scouring the lands for candy. The owners of your property are not in the mood to hand out candy, so they leave out a bowl with a sign to take one. However, you know as the resident guardian ghost, that many kids aren't that obedient. Armed with your trusty garden hose, assure that many kids leave happy and candy-full, no matter the cost!

Press space bar to spray hose to the kids taking more than 1 candy or even turning back! But be careful, if you spray the hose when the kids are good they get compensatory candies in return.
